The cat is known for reading files sequentially and display its output. it
maybe be a simple command line tool, but it has many uses. cat is know a known
tool throght the unix history and has been port over into GNU coreutils. One
important factor about cat is that since because it does not require the files to 
consist of lines of text, but works with any sort of data. 

here are of the option that this tool can do beside display information.

- `-b` (GNU: --number-nonblank), number non-blank output lines
- `-e` implies -v but also display end-of-line characters as $ (GNU only: -E the same, but without implying -v)
- `-n` (GNU: --number), number all output lines
- `-s` (GNU: --squeeze-blank), squeeze multiple adjacent blank lines
- `-t` implies -v, but also display tabs as ^I (GNU: -T the same, but without implying -v)
- `-u` use unbuffered I/O for stdout. POSIX does not specify the behavior without this option.
- `-v` (GNU: --show-nonprinting), displays nonprinting characters, except for tabs and the end of line character
