# About Linux Moles

### Who or What is Linux Moles

LinuxMole website is for CLI junkies, enthusiasm user, power user, developer or anyone who love the Linux and the command line world aka the shell.  Linux, because its the most open and used OS in the world. Moles, because we live in the tunnels (ssh, terminal, and text world) where we dig into place were most normal don't venture and what proper input.

wiki [Command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

> A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as the command-line user interface, console user interface and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text.

The shell, as with all power or magic, has its risks. You can instruct your computer to do anything it has the capability of doing. If you tell your computer to erase all of your data, it will do so with no issue. Make sure you understand what command can do first, especially if the command involves changing or removing files.

### Why the Shell 

Well, the shell is a little harder to learn to use, especially for those who are not used to them. The shell is usually not a problem for developers, Sys Admin, or DevOps because they are often used to command line tools and how powerful they can be, but this could be problematic for less technical people. But, this doesn't mean ordinary people can't use them either.

> Pike tells Wired. "All computing, at some level, is an abstraction and yet deep down beneath there are hardware instructions doing the job. It depends on the level you're working at."


A shell requires a keyboard which is a prompt input for your OS. The shell provides access to lower levels of your computer software and hardware through its interface and tools. A shell can automate processes function in your computer. For example, if you can type it, you can script it, and if you can script it, you can automate it. Also, any input, output, and error can easily be redirected in the shell with many its powerful function and tools. This can allow information to be sent or received from other files, shell, and even other applications. 

###  Reason

- Keying a keyboard is faster in more case, in which a great medium for your thoughts
- Commands have a standard and where GUIs are not because is always changing, for example, POSIX, Unix, and Unix-like system all have similar shell and tools
- A shell is merely is more powerful
