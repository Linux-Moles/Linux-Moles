Hello Fellower Moles, thier is a great tools to have a linux shell on moble devices.
The new Linux command line iSH app on iPad or iPhone With iSH Shell is a Linux shell for iOS that uses an x86 emulator to run a simplified version of Alpine Linux on IOS. You can install packages and additional software directly into iSH with the Alpine package manager. 

Why Alpine Linux you say? Is a Linux distribution based on musl and BusyBox which many power users use. Because of its small size, it's heavily used in containers providing quick boot-up times, which makes a great choice for small userspace on IOS. To Install the iSH Shell into iOS requires TestFlight, which is a developer tool. 

check it out and give a trie on your IOS device.
